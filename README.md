# Chatboat-Agent
# **Building a Customer Support Agent Foundation with Gemini**
## Use Case / Problem:

### Businesses need effective customer support that is responsive, accurate, and available. Traditional methods face challenges:
  1. Human agents can be costly and have limited working hours.
  2. Basic rule-based chatbots lack natural conversation skills and cannot handle complex or unforeseen queries.
  3. Support agents often need access to real-time data (like order status or product availability) which simple bots cannot retrieve.
  4. Analyzing and routing customer requests efficiently can be time-consuming.

### How Generative AI (Gemini) Can Solve This:
> Large Language Models like Google's Gemini offer powerful capabilities to address these challenges:

1. **Natural Language Understanding**: They can understand customer queries phrased in everyday language.
Persona & Tone Control (Few-Shot Prompting): We can guide the AI to adopt a specific persona (e.g., a helpful agent for a particular brand) and response style by providing examples.
2. **Accessing External Tools (Function Calling)**: The AI can be empowered to use external functions or APIs to fetch real-time data (like checking an order database) or perform actions.
3. **Structured Data Generation (JSON Mode)**: The AI can output information in a structured format (like JSON) for easier processing, logging, or routing by other systems.
Goal of this Notebook:

This notebook demonstrates how to use the Google Gemini API and Python to build the foundational components of a customer support agent. We will showcase

### Three key Gen AI capabilities:
1. Few-Shot Prompting (for persona)
2. Function Calling (for data retrieval)
3. Structured Output (for request categorization)
